# Session Notes: 2026-01-15

## Completed

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Editor Feel**: Disabled smooth cursor blinking, smooth caret animation, and smooth scrolling in the Monaco Editor to provide a "snappier", more native feel (similar to standard Windows input).
- **Loading Screen**: Replaced the primitive stick-figure SVG hands with high-quality "open palm" vector icons.
  - Updated `frontend/index.html` with new SVG paths.
  - Maintained the rotating animation while significantly improving the visual quality.

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/editor.ts`: Modified editor configuration.
- `frontend/index.html`: Updated loading screen SVG assets.
- `docs/dev/SESSION_2026-01-15.md`: Created this session log.
